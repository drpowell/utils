My Utilities
==============

- fmtCols - format the columns of a tab (or csv) separated file.  Automatically page the results
- gff-info - Print some stats for a GFF file.  Limited to strange gff2/3 format for now.
- cut.rb - Basic unix 'cut' replacement.  Main idea is that is properly parses CSV files
